# XML Node Parser

--

## Introduction

This is an XML parser, based upon `NSXMLParser`, that parsers a well-formed XML feed into a structure of `ParserNode` objects. The intent is to provide a generalized parser (not hard-coded for any particular feed), that returns data in a structure more robust than simply a combination of `NSDictionary` and `NSArray` objects.

This is a work-in-progress so use at your own risk. But it illustrates how to use `NSXMLParser` to parse an XML feed into a tree-like structure that can be easily navigated.

For more information, see the [`XMLNodeParser` documentation](http://robertmryan.github.com/xml-node-parser/Classes/XMLNodeParser.html).
